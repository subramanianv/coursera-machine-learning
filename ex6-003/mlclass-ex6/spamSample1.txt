During the last week of June the custodians will be cleaning and waxing the floors in the second floor ITB graduate rooms as follows.  Please be sure when you leave the day before your room is scheduled, that everything is picked up off the floor, including all computer equipment, cables, boxes, etc.  If you will not be here between now and then, please arrange for someone else to pick up your items off the floor.  Someone in the room will also need to ensure that things are picked up from and unoccupied areas of the room, such as communal space at the front of the room.  If this is not done, they will not be able to clean the room as scheduled and likely will not get it done this summer.  On the day of the cleaning, the room will be closed until about 10:00 am.
